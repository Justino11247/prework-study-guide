# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 

The motivation behind this project is to store my newfound knowledge from the prework lessons. So that I may reflect back on the building blocks of this course for insight wehen new problems arise. It solves the problem of not being able to access my prework notes at any time. I learned the importaant uses of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.
