        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Styl Sheets(CSS)- a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles apply to a specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Ex: (h1) style=color:red:>Prework Study Guide(/h1)</li>
          <li>Internal Style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>Ex: (head) Line 1
                  (style) Line 2
                    hi { Line 3
                      color:red; Line 4
                    } Line 5
                  (/style) Line 6
          (/head) Line 7</li>
          <li>External CSS style is the most common eway to style a webpage because it allows develpers to keep all their CSS rules in  a seperate file which makes desiogn changes easier</li>
          <li>when using an external style sheet we link the file using a (link) element placed in the HTML's (head)</li>
          <li>(head) Line 1 (link rel="stylesheet" href"./assets/style.css" /) Line 2 (/head) Line 3</li>
          <li>CSS rule- a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declerations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page, it merely adds a buffer</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside of an element</li>

       <li>Github issues usually include a title and description that has user stories and acceptance criteria top describe the the task that needs to be completed</li>
       <li>GitHub flow- Create a feature branch, make changes, commit and push your changes, create a pull request, address/review comments, merge pull request</li>
